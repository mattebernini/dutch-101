# Dutch 101

This simple Flask app basically helps you to learn and practice simple Dutch sentences that you write in a Google Document. You can try it from my website using the following link: http://mattebernini.online/dutch-101

## How it works

From app.py you can edit the doc_url variable with your own Google Document, it must contain 2 sentences for each line separated with a (-), the first sentence is in English and the latter is the Dutch translation.
The Flask app put all your sentences (the English and the Dutch ones) into a table with 2 buttons for each row, the first to listen the Dutch sentence and the second to speak it and check if your pronounciation is correct.
